# Pyscript-Offline

Installable PyScript application that runs offline.

## How it works :question: 

The project ( *hextobin* )
is simply a pwa that cache assets and use them later when there is no internet connection.

The PyScript files along with any other assets (images/css/js) are cached by the application to reduce  startup time and 
most importantly to run offline.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Oussama1403/Pyscript-Offline
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd path/to/Pyscript-Offline
```

Start the server

```bash
  python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1
```
